# This status script combines available bar executables with i3status output
# Procedure for adding something to the status bar:
# - Create an executable file that outputs what you want to add
# - Put it in .bar.d/
# You're done.
# I like to put the actual scripts in bar.d/available and then create a symlink
# to files I want to use in the parent directory. Simply activate/deactivate
# "plugins" if you will.
